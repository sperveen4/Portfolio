            <h2> About me</h2>
            <p>Hey, my name is Shahzia Perveen. I am a first-genertion College Student, majoring in Computer Science at Illinois Institute of Technology.
			I will obtain my Bachelor's degree by Spring 2022. I am skilled at Object Oriented Programming Language (Java), Structured Query Language (SQL),
			Machine Language and have worked with Various technologies. I am motivated to work hard and looking forward to intern with a company that offers opportunities for development and growth,
			so that I can gain real-world experience that I need to be succesful in my career later in life. I am best at collaborating with others in a team setting environment.
			Outside of school, I love cooking for my family. Cooking relieves the stress of studying and working all the time, and it brings my family together.</p>
